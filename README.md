# The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp


This is my repository for my progress through Angela Yu's [Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) 


### Notes
- Issues with deploying on github pages when index.html file was in a subdirectory. Tried a work-around using this [guide](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490)
  - deploying from gh-pages branch. need to push twice from terminal to update both branches, but didn't seem to work when updating.
  
  
### Deployement
- Due to the complications above, the continuation of the personal website will now have a separate repository titled [cv](https://github.com/mcaiox/cv).
